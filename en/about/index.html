          <h2>Who’s behind Right Business Mentors</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Rafael Bermudez, and I am a tax preparer in the United
            States. Right Business Mentors was created from firsthand experience
            working with people who, year after year, face the tax process with
            questions, stress, or incomplete information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over time, I realized that many individuals and small businesses
            don’t just need someone to prepare a tax return—they need someone
            who can explain the process, provide guidance, and help them
            understand how their financial decisions directly impact their
            taxes.
          </p>

          <p>
            That’s why my approach goes beyond filling out forms. I focus on
            helping each client understand their tax situation and make more
            informed decisions, both in the short and long term.
          </p>

          <h2>About the firm</h2>
          <p>
            Right Business Mentors is an independent tax preparation firm
            serving individuals, families, self-employed professionals, and
            small businesses that want to grow in an organized way while staying
            fully compliant with their tax obligations.
          </p>

          <p>
            The name reflects my philosophy: not just to provide a service, but
            to act as a mentor—guiding clients through tax compliance, financial
            organization, and responsible planning over time.
          </p>

          <h2>Professional training and preparation</h2>
          <p>
            My work is grounded primarily in professional tax preparation. I am
            a <strong>Professional Tax Preparer</strong>, with specialized
            training in tax preparation and planning, allowing me to deliver
            services aligned with IRS requirements and focused on responsible
            tax compliance.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also have a background in software engineering, which brings a
            structured mindset, attention to detail, and secure, well-organized
            handling of client information.
          </p>

          <p>
            I stay continuously up to date with IRS regulations and tax law
            changes to ensure the guidance I provide reflects current rules and
            best practices.
          </p>
