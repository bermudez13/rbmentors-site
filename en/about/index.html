          <h2>Who is behind Right Business Mentors</h2>
          <p>
            My name is <strong>Rafael Bermudez</strong>, and I am a tax preparer
            in the United States. Right Business Mentors was created based on
            firsthand experience working with individuals who, year after year,
            approach the tax process with questions, stress, or incomplete
            information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over time, it became clear that many individuals and small
            businesses require more than tax return preparation. They also need
            clear explanations, guidance, and a better understanding of how
            their financial decisions directly affect their tax situation.
          </p>

          <p>
            For this reason, the approach goes beyond completing forms. The
            focus is on helping each client understand their tax position and
            make informed decisions, both in the short and long term.
          </p>

          <h2>About the firm</h2>
          <p>
            Right Business Mentors is an independent tax preparation firm
            serving individuals, families, self-employed professionals, and
            small businesses seeking organized growth and proper compliance with
            their tax obligations.
          </p>

          <p>
            The name reflects the firm’s philosophy: not only to provide a
            service, but to act as a mentor—supporting clients through tax
            compliance, financial organization, and responsible planning over
            time.
          </p>

          <h2>Professional training and preparation</h2>
          <p>
            The service is grounded in professional tax preparation. I am a
            <strong>Professional Tax Preparer</strong> with specialized training
            in tax preparation and planning, allowing services to be delivered
            in alignment with IRS requirements and a strong focus on responsible
            compliance.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, I have a background in software engineering, which
            brings a structured mindset, attention to detail, and secure,
            well-organized handling of client information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ongoing education and regulatory updates ensure that guidance
            remains aligned with current IRS regulations and established best
            practices.
